# What are Earthquakes

Earthquakes are sudden movements of the Earth's surface caused by energy released from within the Earth. This energy travels as waves, shaking the ground.

## Why Do Earthquakes Happen

The Earthâ€™s outer shell, called the crust, is broken into pieces known as tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving. Sometimes they get stuck due to friction causing them to suddenly slip. The built-up energy from this is released in what we experience as Earthquakes.

## How Do We Measure Earthquakes
Earthquakes are measured using scales like the Richter scale and the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS), which quantify their magnitude and intensity based on seismic wave data.The Moment Magnitude Scale is currently the most reliable method for quantifying earthquake size, while the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale provides insight into the effects of the earthquake on people and structures.

### Moment Magnitude Scale
The data presented in this website uses the Moment Magnitude Scale.  It measures the total energy released by an earthquake, taking the area of the fault that slipped and the amount of slip into account. This scale provides a more accurate representation of an earthquake's size, particularly for larger events, when compared the Richter Scale. 

### Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale
There is another meausrment scale used, the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which measures the intensity of shacking experienced by people and structures, not the energy relesased. This scale goes from I to X, where I describes a bearly preceptible Earthquake and X describes widespread destruction. 

### Instruments Used to Measure Earthquakes
 Earthquakes are recorded by a network of seismographic stations that measure ground movement. These instruments detect the vibrations caused by seismic waves and help determine both the magnitude and intensity of the earthquake. 

## Where Do Earthquakes Happen
Make use of the interactive World Map on the Dashboard. Do you see any patterns?

Most earthquakes occur along Techtonic Plate Boundaries. On the World Map are you able to make out the techtonic plate lines bassed on the earthquae locations? 

The most active techtonic plate boundaries are: the Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean, the Himalayan region (where India meets Aisa) and fault zones like the San Andreas Fault in California. 

## What about Tsunamis
Large undersea earthquakes can displace huge volumes of water, creating tsunamis. Tsunamis arepowerful ocean waves that can travel across entire oceans. Not every earthquake causes a tsunami, but the most dangerous ones are usually deep-sea quakes near subduction zones.

Are you able to identify any recent deep sea earthquakes?

## Can We Predict Earthquakes
Use the interactive time-lines and plots in the Data Analysis page. From these are you able to find any pattern relating to earthquake prediction? 

Is there a time pattern visible, or a location pattern?

At this pont in time, earthquakes can not be reliably predicted, however the liklihood of future earthquakes in a region can be estimated. Are you able to estimate any?
